# Max LED Lighting project

## **Description:**
The Max LED Lighting project addresses the challenge of efficiently connecting LEDs to power sources. With two circuit boards (S and L) and unsorted LEDs, Dynamic Programming is employed to find the optimal solution, considering the constraint of avoiding wire crossing. The program takes the number of LEDs (n) and a permutation of numbers representing the ordering of LEDs on board L as input, outputting the maximum number of illuminated LEDs and their respective connections.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Dynamic Programming:** Utilized for optimizing LED and power source pairing.
- **DP Table:** Displays the decision-making process and connections.
- **Graphical Representation:** Offers a user-friendly interface for visualizing LED connections. The graphical representation is detailed for a small number of LEDs, adapting to a simpler version for larger LED and wire connections.

The project provides a comprehensive solution, visualizing decision-making and demonstrating LED connections through a user-friendly interface.
